This TASK2 directory contains code for 2D rigid part recognition.

Use the test data in directory TESTDATA1 from TASK1.

May require some utility matlab scripts from 
http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/av/MATLAB/UTILITIES/
(e.g. mygauswin.m liveimagejpg.m)

1) execute doall.m in matlab (doall)
2) Use scale factor = 30.9 and saved datasets as "TESTDATA1/f"

True object classes : "T" part = 1; small base "L" = 2; large base "L" = 3

N.B. Only 12 images in test set so choose (0, i.e. no after processing 12 images).
