----------------------------

Background removal and general cleaning-up of the image to separate the hand is
currently working ok. Future work can be done on the threshold optimization for
cleaning up.

The next step is to create the bounding box.
Removing the spurs (removeSpurs.m) can wait until it is trully needed.

To find the bounding box the matlab function used in IVR which takes a binary
image as input and returns objects based on properties like area can be used.

The next step then would be moment invariants.
